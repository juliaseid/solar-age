## Description

_This web application uses classes, looping, and arrays to calculate a user's age in solar years on the different planets in our solar system.  In the "User" class, the user's "earth age" is calculated in Earth days, and their remaining (or exceeded) life expectancy is also calculated.  Those numbers are received by a class of "Planet" calculators, with one extension of that class for each planet._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repository from GitHub in terminal or console
* npm install
* npm run start


## Specs

* - The program takes in a user's birthdate through a 'date' input form and returns a user's age in Earth days.
    * Input: December 1, 1982
    * Output: You are 13,652 days old, which means you are 37!  You are expected to live about 17,500 more days - that's age 85!

* - The program offers users the choice of 7 other planets on which to see their age and life expectancy.
    * Input: "Mars"
    * Output:  "You chose Mars!  On Mars, you would have just celebrated your 70th birthday!  You'd have about 90 years left to live.
